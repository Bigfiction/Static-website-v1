<p>You can call me Jeremy, but many nicknames are on rotation from the different walks of my life.</p>

<p>I hear:</p>

<ul>
    <li>JHawk</li>
    <li>Hawk</li>
    <li>J.P. <i>(becuase my middle name is Philip)</i></li>
    <li>Jerm <i>(or Germ)</i></li>
    <li>Jare-Bear</li>
</ul>

<p> It has been a <em>long</em> time since I exercised HTML skills - long enough to feel a persistent panic while 
    reaquainting myself with the rules.  But I'm keeping my head down and trying to plow through it.</p>
   
<p>How are we doing so far?  Still with me?  Feel free to leave questions, concerns or emotional outbursts in the comment section...</p>

<p>...Oh? <strong>Gulp</strong>. There isn't a comment section yet?</p>
<p>Hey look!  A top level heading.</p>

<h2>Moving On</h2>

<p>This site will expand in parallel with my digital writing skills, and I look forward to that journey.</p>
<p>4662W is my final class before graduating, and my aim is to develop this site into a portfolio that satisfies my capstone.</p>

<h2>Final Note</h2>

<p>It is impossible to overstate the importance of voting in the next election.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the <a href="https://advocates.umn.edu/vote">Voter Registraion</a> page provided by the U of MN.</p>
